# Performance Improvements and Memory Leak Prevention

This document outlines the improvements made to prevent memory leaks and improve performance in the SuiVerse application.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Logger Utility
- Created a centralized logger utility (`src/utils/logger.ts`) that disables console logs in production mode.
- This reduces memory and CPU usage by preventing excessive logging in the production environment.
- Only error logs are preserved in production for critical issue tracking.

### 2. Safe Timer Management
- Created `useSafeTimeout` and `useSafeInterval` hooks (`src/hooks/use-safe-timer.ts`).
- These hooks ensure that timers are automatically cleared when components unmount.
- Prevents common memory leaks caused by timers continuing to run after a component is no longer in the DOM.

### 3. Event Listener Management
- Added `useEventListener` and related hooks (`src/hooks/use-event-listener.ts`).
- Ensures proper cleanup of event listeners when components unmount.
- Prevents accumulation of event listeners that can cause memory leaks and performance degradation.

### 4. Memory Management Utilities
- Added utilities to help with memory management (`src/utils/memoryManagement.ts`).
- Includes tools to detect circular references and potential memory leaks.
- Provides a WeakCache implementation for safely caching objects without causing memory leaks.

### 5. Component Cleanup Utilities
- Created a cleanup utility (`src/utils/cleanup.ts`) that helps manage cleanup operations.
- Provides methods for safely setting and clearing timers and event listeners.
- Implements patterns to prevent resources from being held after they're no longer needed.

## Usage Guidelines

### Using the Logger
```typescript
import logger from '@/utils/logger';

// Instead of console.log
logger.log('This message will only appear in development');

// Instead of console.warn
logger.warn('This warning will only appear in development');

// Errors still show in production
logger.error('This error will be logged in all environments');
```

### Using Safe Timers
```typescript
import { useSafeTimeout, useSafeInterval } from '@/hooks';

function MyComponent() {
  const timeout = useSafeTimeout();
  const interval = useSafeInterval();
  
  // Instead of setTimeout
  timeout.set(() => {
    // Do something
  }, 1000);
  
  // Instead of setInterval
  interval.set(() => {
    // Do something repeatedly
  }, 1000);
  
  // These will be automatically cleared when the component unmounts
}
```

### Using Event Listeners
```typescript
import { useEventListener, useCustomEvent } from '@/hooks';

function MyComponent() {
  // Add event listener that is automatically cleaned up
  useEventListener('resize', () => {
    // Handle resize
  }, window);
  
  // For custom events
  useCustomEvent('moduleCompleted', (event) => {
    // Handle custom event
  });
}
```

## Ongoing Improvements

Additional improvements that could be made:
1. Converting more components to use the safe timer and event listener hooks
2. Implementing memoization for expensive computations
3. Adding virtualization for long lists to improve rendering performance
4. Further reducing unnecessary re-renders using React.memo and useMemo
5. Implementing code splitting to reduce bundle size
